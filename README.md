# Project Brief: `Project Manager Web App` - Hai Chung

*Here, describe your project as concisely as possible, ideally in two sentences. One sentence to describe the idea, and one sentence to explain why it's remarkable.*

A project manager is a must have for every person, team and organization. This project manager web app is based on the concept of "kanban board" used by Toyota in the 1940s with more features such as: viewing as lists, timeline, drag and drop to change status of task items, create and manage project as flow chart, embed facebook messenger or discord for communication, adding tasks onto google calendar, gmail notification...

**Disclaimer: This idea is just a draft.** Everything above and below is completely from imagination. Apologies if i can't finished them all. Some features are for future improvement.

### Motivations + Problems

*Why is this project useful? Why were you interested in working on it? What hair-on-fire problems do you see?*

I always struggle on keep track of things, time and works management and can not find any product good enough for me that is free or cheap. Therefore I want to make this to be a product that could help me work more efficient and less time consumming.
I will make a Vietnamese version in the future for those that not speak English in my country. I feel like we lack of products like this.
